# FitFlora Mobile Application

## Overview

FitFlora is an innovative mobile application designed to integrate fitness, horticulture, and community engagement within Beijingâ€™s urban parks. By linking exercise to urban agriculture, FitFlora enables park-goers to contribute to sustainable food production while promoting a healthier lifestyle.


## Features & Libraries Involved

- **QR Code Scanner**: Utilizes the device's camera to scan QR codes attached to exercise machines, triggering the start of the session.
- **Google Maps**: Integrated into the app to provide users with nearby park locations, vending machines, and vertical farming installations.
- **Firebase**: Acts as the central database, managing user data, plant growth statistics, and reward points. It also connects the IoT devices, digital twins, and mobile application components, enabling real-time interaction and updates.
- **Notification System**: Sends real-time notifications to users about their plant's status, session reminders, and rewards. It helps keep users engaged with the system.
- **Dependency Injection**: Ensures a modular architecture within the app, allowing different components (e.g., QR scanning, IoT interactions, and Firebase communication) to be efficiently managed and easily updated without hard dependencies.


## How It Works

1. **Scan & Start**: Scan the QR code on an exercise machine using the FitFlora app to begin your session.
2. **Exercise & Grow**: Your physical activity is linked to plant growth, contributing to sustainable urban agriculture.
3. **Earn Points**: After completing your session, earn points based on your contributions to plant and personal health.
4. **Redeem Rewards**: Use your points to claim fresh produce from vending machines located near your home.
